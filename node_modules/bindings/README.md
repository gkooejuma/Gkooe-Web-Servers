node-bindings
=============
### Helper module for loading your native module's `.node` file

This is a helper module for authors of Node.js native addon modules.
It is basically the "swiss army knife" of `require()`ing your native module's
`.node` file.

Throughout the course of Node's native addon history, addons have ended up being
compiled in a variety of different places, depending on which build tool and which
version of node was used. To make matters worse, now the `gyp` build tool can
produce either a __Release__ or __Debug__ build, each being built into different
locations.

This module checks _all_ the possible locations that a native addon would be built
at, and returns the first one that loads successfully.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install --save bindings
```

Or add it to the `"dependencies"` section of your `package.json` file.


Example
-------

`require()`ing the proper bindings file for the current node version, platform
and architecture is as simple as:

``` js
var bindings = require('bindings')('binding.node')

// Use your bindings defined in your C files
bindings.your_c_function()
